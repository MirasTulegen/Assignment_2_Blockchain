Report on Rock-Paper-Scissors Smart Contract and Front-End

This report describes a smart contract and front-end implementation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The smart contract is written in Solidity and deployed to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The front-end is written in React and deployed to Vercel.

Smart Contract

The smart contract implements the following features:

Players can create and join games.
Players can play a move in a game.
The contract calculates the winner of a game.
The winner of a game can withdraw their winnings.
The smart contract also includes a mapping to store the game history of each player.

Front-End

The front-end allows players to:

Create and join games.
Play a move in a game.
View the game history.
Withdraw their winnings.

Multi-Address Support

The smart contract and front-end both support multi-address play. This means that players can play against each other using different addresses.
